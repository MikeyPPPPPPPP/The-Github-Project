# The-Github-Project
Gets code from github.

I had an idea for a website
    put all frontend code on github while so it would be online and the backup would be on my computer
    
The idea was to run code that is not on my computer, just one step in a dumb idea I had for trying to make a free 
website with unlimited storage, I would use github, google doc, things like that.
